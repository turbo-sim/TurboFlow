Tutorial 2: Performance of a multi-stage turbine
=====================================================

Functionality to demonstrate:

- Load YAML file with geometry of two stage turbine
- Explain that there are no big different with respec tto single-stage (some vectors are longer)
- The root finding problem becomes larger and the solution time is longer
- Plot the performance map of the two-stage turbine
- Discuss that the choking calculation automatically determines which cascades are choked
