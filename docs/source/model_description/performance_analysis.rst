Performance analysis
======================



Description of how to evaluate the turbine performance

- Cascade modeling equations
- Evaluation of inlet, throat, and outlet
- Computation of critical Mach number (Lagrange multipliers)
- Choking formulation is general and covers all cases
- Formulation of the system of equations for a cascade (residuals)
- Solution with a root finding algorithm
- Multiple operating points to get the performance map
