Design optimization
======================

Description of how to optimize the turbine geometry

- Modeling equations same as for performance analysis
- Independent variables extended with a subset of dimensionless geometry parameters
- Design variables are all dimensionless and well-scaled
- Constraints added to ensure feasible design
- Bounds for the design variables
- Objective function defined by the user (total-to-static) efficiency
- Optimization with gradient based algorithms
- Extension to multi-point optimization problems
