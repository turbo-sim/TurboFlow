 abstract = {Axial turbines are the most common turbine configuration for electric power generation and propulsion systems due to their versatility in terms of power capacity and range of operating conditions. Mean-line models are essential for the preliminary design of axial turbines and, despite being covered to some extent in turbomachinery textbooks, only some scientific publications present a comprehensive formulation of the preliminary design problem. In this context, a mean-line model and optimization methodology for the preliminary design of axial turbines with any number of stages is proposed. The model is formulated to use arbitrary equations of state and empirical loss models and it accounts for the influence of the diffuser on turbine performance using a one-dimensional flow model. The mathematical problem was formulated as a constrained, optimization problem, and solved using gradient-based algorithms. In addition, the model was validated against two test cases from the literature and it was found that the deviation between experimental data and model prediction in terms of mass flow rate and power output was less than 1.2\% for both cases and that the deviation of the total-to-static efficiency was within the uncertainty of the empirical loss models. Moreover, the optimization methodology was applied to a case study from the literature and a sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the influence of several variables on turbine performance, concluding that: (1) the minimum hub-to-tip ratio constraint is always active at the outlet of the last rotor and that its value should be selected as a trade-off of aerodynamic performance and mechanical integrity; (2) that the total-to-static isentropic efficiency of turbines without diffuser deteriorates rapidly when the pressure ratio is increased; and (3) that there exist a loci of maximum efficiency in the specific speed and specific diameter plane (Baljé diagram) that can be predicted with a simple analytical expression.},

@inproceedings{anderson_method_2022,
 abstract = {Today, expanders for Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) are either inefficient or expensive. One reason for this is that expanders of power conversion systems usually operate under different conditions over an annual perspective. Still, they are designed to perform best at a single operating point. In view of this limitation, it is suggested that the overall expander performance can be improved by taking into account off-design operation in the design process. As the first step in this direction, this paper presents a two-fold method for design optimization and performance analysis of one-stage axial turbines. The method utilizes the same mean-line model for performance analysis and design optimization, ensuring consistency between the two modes. In addition, the proposed method evaluates the turbine performance at three stations for each blade row: inlet, throat and exit, and employs a novel numerical treatment of flow choking that automatically determines which blade rows are choked as part of the solution. Furthermore, the method was validated against cold-air experimental data from three different one-stage axial turbines, at both on- and off-design conditions. The model predicts design point efficiencies between 1.1 and 4.5 percentage points off the experimental values. The model was also able to capture the trend of mass flow rate as a function of total-to-static pressure ratio and angular speed. However, an unphysical behavior was observed as the pressure ratio approaches the critical value, and further developments of the model are required. It is envisioned that the proposed method will serve as foundation for a robust design methodology that will enable higher expander performance over a range of operating conditions.},

 abstract = {There is no doubt that the determination of a smart charging-discharging pattern can be very effective in increasing the cost-effectiveness and overall energy efﬁciency of an energy storage system. For ﬁnding the optimal operation strategy of the energy storage unit of a renewable power plant, the electricity spot price, the forecast data of energy availability, and the regulations of the local power market should all be taken into account. In addition to these economic considerations, the effect of deviation from the nominal load (partial-load operation) on the performance of the energy storage system is a critical parameter that directly affects the optimal operation pattern of the system in real-life energy markets. In this study, the effects of partial-load work of a low-temperature compressed air energy storage system on its overall performance are investigated thermodynamically employing real performance maps of all the components of the system. The results of the study indicate that the energy storage system needs to operate around nominal design conditions if it is expected to perform efﬁciently. The round-trip efﬁciency of the unit approaches 68\% at a nominal load while it offers the low efﬁciencies of 52\% and 28\% if working at 50\% and 10\% loads, respectively.},

@article{bahamonde_method_2017,
 abstract = {Widespread adoption of renewable energy technologies will arguably benefit from the availability of economically viable distributed thermal power conversion systems. For this reason, considerable efforts have been dedicated in recent years to R\&D over mini-organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power plants, thus with a power capacity approximately in the 3–50 kW range. The application of these systems for waste heat recovery from diesel engines of long-haul trucks stands out because of the possibility of achieving economy of production. Many technical challenges need to be solved, as the system must be sufficiently efficient, light, and compact. The design paradigm is therefore completely different from that of conventional stationary ORC power plants of much larger capacity. A high speed turbine is arguably the expander of choice, if high conversion efficiency is targeted, thus high maximum cycle temperature. Given the lack of knowledge on the design of these turbines, which depends on a large number of constraints, a novel optimal design method integrating the preliminary design of the thermodynamic cycle and that of the turbine has been developed. The method is applicable to radial inflow, axial and radial outflow turbines, and to superheated and supercritical cycle configurations. After a limited number of working fluids are selected, the feasible design space is explored by means of thermodynamic cycle design calculations integrated with a simplified turbine design procedure, whereby the isentropic expansion efficiency is prescribed. Starting from the resulting design space, optimal preliminary designs are obtained by combining cycle calculations with a 1D mean-line code, subject to constraints. The application of the procedure is illustrated for a test case: the design of turbines to be tested in a new experimental setup named organic rankine cycle hybrid integrated device (ORCHID) which is being constructed at the Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands. The first turbine selected for further design and construction employs siloxane MM (hexamethyldisiloxane, C6H18OSi2), supercritical cycle, and the radial inflow configuration. The main preliminary design specifications are power output equal to 11.6 kW, turbine inlet temperature equal to 300 °C, maximum cycle pressure equal to 19.9 bar, expansion ratio equal to 72, rotational speed equal to 90 krpm, inlet diameter equal to 75 mm, minimum blade height equal to 2 mm, degree of reaction equal to 0.44, and estimated total-to-static efficiency equal to 77.3\%. Results of the design calculations are affected by considerable uncertainty related to the loss correlations employed for the preliminary turbine design, as they have not been validated yet for this highly unconventional supersonic and transonic mini turbine. Future work will be dedicated to the extension of the method to encompass the preliminary design of heat exchangers and the off-design operation of the system.},

The aerofoils for the two cascades were designed for the same inlet and outlet conditions and differ mainly in their leading-edge geometries. Detailed flow field measurements were made upstream and downstream of the cascades using three and seven-hole pressure probes and static pressure distributions were measured on the aerofoil surfaces. All measurements were made exclusively at the design incidence. The results from this experiment suggest that the strength of the passage vortex plays an important role in the downstream flow field and loss behavior. It was concluded that the aerofoil loading distribution has a significant influence on the strength of this vortex. In contrast, the leading-edge geometry appears to have only a minor influence on the secondary flow field, at least for the design incidence.},

@article{casati_centrifugal_2014,
 abstract = {Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems are rapidly diffusing as a technology for the conversion of thermal energy sources in the small-to-medium power range, e. g., from 150 kW(e) up to several MWe. The most critical component is arguably the expander, especially if the power capacity is small or very small, as it is the case for innovative high-potential applications such as waste heat recovery from truck engines, or distributed conversion of concentrated solar radiation. In these so-called high-temperature applications, the expansion ratio is very high; therefore, turbines are the expanders of choice. Recently, multistage radial-outflow turbines (ROT), a nonconventional turbine configuration, have been studied, and first commercial implementations in the MWe power range have been successful. The objective of this work is the evaluation of the radial-outflow arrangement for the turbine of high-temperature mini-ORC power systems, with power output of the order of 10 kW(e). To this end, a method for the preliminary fluid-dynamic design is presented. It consists of an automated optimization procedure based on an in-house mean-line code for the one-dimensional preliminary design and efficiency estimation of turbines. It is first shown that usually adopted simplified design procedures, such as that of the so-called repeating-stage, cannot be extended to minicentrifugal turbines. The novel methodology is applied to the exemplary case of the 10 kW(e) turbine of an ORC power system for truck engine heat recovery documented in the literature. The expansion ratio is 45. The preliminary fluid-dynamic design of two miniturbines is presented, namely, a five-stage transonic and a three-stage slightly supersonic turbine. The outcome of the preliminary design leads to two turbine configurations whose fluid-dynamic efficiency exceeds 79\% and 77\%, respectively. The speed of revolution is around 12,400 and 15,400 RPM for the five-stage and the three-stage machine, respectively. These results show that the ROT configuration may allow for compact and efficient expanders for low power output applications.},

Three notable contributions of AXOD2 to its predecessor AXOD, both in the context of the Guide or in the functionality of the code, are described and discussed in length. These are: 1) a rational representation of the mathematical principles applied, with concise descriptions of the formulas implemented in the actual coding. Their physical implications are addressed; 2) the creation and documentation of an ‘Addendum Listing’ of input namelist-parameters unique to AXOD2, that differ from or are in addition to the original input-namelists given in the Manual of AXOD. Their usages are discussed; and 3) the institution of proper stoppages of the code execution, encoding termination messaging and error messages of the execution to AXOD2. These measures are to safe-guard the integrity of the code execution, such that a failure mode encountered during a case-study would not plunge the code execution into indefinite loop, or cause a blow-out of the program execution. Details on these are discussed and illustrated in this paper. Moreover, this computer program has since been reconstructed substantially. Standard FORTRAN Langue was instituted, and the code was formatted in Double Precision (REAL*8). As the result, the code is now suited for use in a local Desktop Computer Environment, is perfectly portable to any Operating System, and can be executed by any FORTRAN compiler equivalent to a FORTRAN 90/95 compiler.

In addition, ORC power systems are suitable for the cogeneration of heating and/or cooling, another advantage in the framework of distributed power generation. Related research and development is therefore very lively. These considerations motivated the effort documented in this article, aimed at providing consistent information about the evolution, state, and future of this power conversion technology. First, basic theoretical elements on the thermodynamic cycle, working fluid, and design aspects are illustrated, together with an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages in comparison to competing technologies. An overview of the long history of the development of ORC power systems follows, in order to place the more recent evolution into perspective. Then, a compendium of the many aspects of the state of the art is illustrated: the solutions currently adopted in commercial plants and the main-stream applications, including information about exemplary installations. A classification and terminology for ORC power plants are proposed. An outlook on the many research and development activities is provided, whereby information on new high-impact applications, such as automotive heat recovery is included. Possible directions of future developments are highlighted, ranging from efforts targeting volume-produced stationary and mobile mini-ORC systems with a power output of few kW(e), up to large MWe base-load ORC plants.},

 abstract = {The variation of extraction pressures with flow to the following stage for high backpressure, multistage turbine designs is highly nonlinear in typical cogeneration applications where the turbine nozzles are not choked. Consequently, the linear method based on Constant Flow Coefficient, which is applicable for uncontrolled expansion with high vacuum exhaust, as is common in utility power cycles, cannot be used to predict extraction pressures at off-design loads. The paper presents schematic examples and brief descriptions of cogeneration designs, with background and theoretical derivation of a more generalized “nozzle analogy” which is applicable in these cases. This method is known as the Law of the Ellipse. It was originally developed experimentally by Stodola and published in English in 1927. The paper shows that the Constant Flow Coefficient method is really a special case of the more generalized Law of the Ellipse. Graphic interpretation of the Law of the Ellipse for controlled and uncontrolled expansions, and variations for sonic choking and reduced number of stages (including single stage) are presented. The derived relations are given in computer codable form, and methods of solution integral with overall heat balance iteration schemes are suggested, with successful practical experience. The pressures predicted by the relations compare favorably with manufacturers’ data on four high-backpressure, cogeneration cycle turbines and three large utility low-pressure ends.},

 abstract = {A mean-line model of radial inflow turbines in ORC systems is developed.•The model includes a novel design and performance analysis procedure.•Optimum values of specific speed and velocity ratio are obtained.•The influence of the size and expansion ratio on the design efficiency is evaluated. Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems represent an efficient technology for power generation from low-to-medium temperature heat sources. Most of the efforts in the recent literature are addressed to the improvement of turbine design and efficiency by taking advantage of the low enthalpy drops while dealing with the large volume flow ratios across the expansion process and low speed of sound typical of high molecular weight fluids. These peculiar conditions make the choice and the design of an ORC turbine a challenging task, exacerbated by the only few experimental data available in the open literature. The aim of this paper is to obtain the optimum design and corresponding maximum efficiency of single stage radial inflow turbines for different cycle design specifications (i.e., mass flow rate and enthalpy drop) using the real gas properties of refrigerant R245fa. This aim is pursued by means of a mean-line model developed in Matlab® which includes the design and performance analysis procedure suggested by Aungier (2005). Results indicate how different design choices in terms of specific speed and velocity ratio, and different working conditions in terms of expansion ratio and turbine size may affect the efficiency of single stage radial inflow turbines in ORC systems.},

This paper is aimed providing a freely available system that can be used by individuals or small companies who do not have access to an in-house system. The design system is based on the three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver Multall, which has been developed over many years. Multall can obtain solutions for individual blade rows or for multistage machines, and it can also perform quasi-3D (Q3D) blade-to-blade calculations on a prescribed stream surface and axisymmetric throughflow calculations. Multall is combined with a one-dimensional (1D) mean-line program, Meangen, which predicts the blading parameters on a mean stream surface and writes an input file for Stagen. Stagen is a blade geometry generation and manipulation program which generates and stacks the blading, combines it into stages, and writes an input file for Multall. The system can be used to design the main blade path of all types of turbomachines. Although it cannot design complex features such as shroud seals and individual cooling holes, these features can be modeled, and their effect on overall performance predicted. The system is intended to be as simple and easy to use as possible, and the solver is also very fast compared to most CFD codes. A great deal of user experience ensures that the overall performance is reasonably well predicted for a wide variety of machines. This paper describes the system in outline and gives an example of its use. The source codes are written in FORTRAN77 and are freely available for other users to try.},

The design involves some trial-and-error, especially if the profile is initially prescribed by solely aerodynamic or solely mechanical requirements. A new design technique is described in which both aerodynamic and mechanical requirements are prescribed. The shape is defined by an algebraic function of eight parameters: blade inlet and outlet angle, maximum thickness, trailing edge thickness and wedge angle, leading edge radius, and the points of maximum thickness and maximum camber. Some of these are chosen to satisfy mechanical requirements, and curves are given recommending the best values of the remaining parameters from aerodynamic considerations, with the exception of the position of maximum camber. By varying that over a narrow range, a good shape can quickly be selected. A computer program for designing blades this way and analyzing blades designed in other ways is described.},

@article{esfahanian_mean-line_2024,
 abstract = {Compressible flow turbines usually work under choked conditions, requiring an analysis for the performance estimation. The Mean-line modeling is a fast and accurate method extensively used for the analysis and design purposes. However, it has not already been well-investigated for axial flow turbines specially in choked conditions. The present study investigates the issue from three novel aspects. First, a detailed study is accomplished on the inconsistencies of Mean-line method respect to the physics of real flows. It is discussed that the conditions related to maximum mass flow rate through a nozzle and the Mach number one at the throat are different. In fact, the latter condition is not quite physical. Second, a complete algorithm is utilized to implement the aforementioned considerations for the analysis of turbines. This algorithm includes an innovative Blade Solution Algorithm (BSA) and Turbine Solution Algorithm (TSA). The BSA solves the blade rows of turbine using the basic laws of Physics and real-gas properties. In the TSA, a robust and efficient procedure is presented so the solution of turbine converges in wide ranges of boundary conditions with minimum iterations. The results demonstrate that the algorithm generate close maps to the previous studies. Eventually in the third part, since a fast and robust Mean-line algorithm is crucial in optimization, the code is utilized for a design based on optimization using the Genetic Algorithm. In this procedure, all geometrical parameters are optimized as decision parameters rather than the use of old and approximate correlations. This is done along with novel constraints, which not only maximizes efficiency, but also puts the output power, mass flow rate and turbine size in appropriate ranges. The optimization results in a 3.5\% rise in efficiency.},

@article{fiaschi_design_2015,
 abstract = {In this paper, a zero-dimensional model for the design of radial turbo-expanders for ORC applications is discussed, with special reference to the estimation of losses and efficiency; a comparison between different fluids (R134a, R1234yf, R236fa, R245fa, Cyclohexane, N-Pentane) is presented and discussed, referring to a typical small-size application (50kW). In the model, different methods for the design of radial turbines are screened, with special attention to the estimation of losses, for which correlations from literature are used. Real Equations Of State (EOS) are applied to the expansion process in place of the traditionally adopted Mach relationships for ideal gas, which is a significant advancement for modeling organic fluids in ORC, often operating near to critical conditions. The results show that the total to total efficiency of the designed machines range between 0.72 and 0.80, depending on the considered fluid. Generally, higher efficiency (1.5–2.5\% points) can be achieved adopting backswept-bladed rotors. The most significant losses come from the rotor secondary flows, due to the high curvature of blade profiles combined to the large pressure gradient. The best performing fluids are R236fa and R245fa, followed by R134a and R1234yf. Finally, starting from the developed design tool, an off-design analysis of turbo-expanders is presented. Once the design data are available, the characteristic curves of the expander at variable temperature, pressure and fluid mass flowrate at the expander inlet for different values of the specific speed are built. It is thus possible to evaluate the performance of the radial expanders when working far from design point. This analysis, demonstrated for R134a, shows that the total to static efficiency has a relatively modest sensitivity to the off design of the expansion ratio, especially at corrected speed below the design value.},

The goal of the work was to develop and verify a program suitable for scientific studies of axial turbines. The program has built-in capability for multiple choked stages, and turbine cooling, as well as flexible modules for state, losses, deviation, and blockage. The code uses Matlab™ as a platform for numerics, pre- and post-processing. The turbine modules are available from the Institute free of charge for scientific use. Matlab is a commercially available mathematical package and is used as a numerical tool by many universities and companies. Today, several codes are available for turbine analysis at different levels. Most of the codes are proprietary and not available outside the companies that have developed them. There are, however, commercially available codes, but the user does not normally have accesses to the source code. This poses serious problems when such codes are used for scientific studies, and open easily modified code is indeed a desirable feature. The present paper describes in detail the calculation methods used to simulate performance of a cooled and choked turbine at off-design conditions. The algorithms necessary for finding the turbine choke point will, for example, be described in detail. The way in which the loss, deviation (including secondary and tip clearance), and blockage are included in a quasi 1-D calculation environment is also presented. The code is suitable for further development (e.g. streamline curvature through-flow), since it is based on modules for e.g. state, combustion, loss, deviation, diffuser, numerics, and in-and output data processing. It is fairly easy to transform the Matlab program into e.g. Fortran. However, the use of the original platform simplifies plotting of turbine characteristics, velocity triangles, etc. The program is validated against test-rig data from an industrial two-stage power turbine.},

Other applications of interest for turbine engines include land-vehicle (cars, trucks, buses, trains, etc.) propulsion power and ground-based electrical power. In view of the turbine-system interest and efforts at Lewis Research Center, a course entitled 'Turbine Design and Application' was presented during 1968-69 as part of the In-house Graduate Study Program. The course was somewhat revised and again presented in 1972-73. Various aspects of turbine technology were covered including thermodynamic and fluid-dynamic concepts, fundamental turbine concepts, velocity diagrams, losses, blade aerodynamic design, blade cooling, mechanical design, operation, and performance. The notes written and used for the course have been revised and edited for publication. Such a publication can serve as a foundation for an introductory turbine course, a means for self-study, or a reference for selected topics. Any consistent set of units will satisfy the equations presented. Two commonly used consistent sets of units and constant values are given after the symbol definitions.

Six study cases were considered: heavy duty gas turbines in simple and combined cycle, aero-derivative gas turbines, large-scale supercritical coal power plants and small- and mid-scale sub-critical coal power plants. The most critical operational processes and pollutants associated with these plants were identified. Then, data was collected mainly from manufacturers, but also from academic research and grey literature. The data was compared and analyzed. Detailed comparisons of the power plant characteristics as well as the current and future flexibility and emissions are provided. Furthermore, a method to quantify the ability of conventional power plants to back-up renewables and the expected benefits from improved flexibility is proposed and evaluated. Results show that gas-fired power plants are not only more efficient, but also faster and generally less polluting than coal-fired power plants. However, at their respective minimum complaint load, gas plants are less flexible and produced more NOx and CO emissions than coal-fired power plants. Results also show that on average, an improvement of approximately 50\% to 100\% on power ramp rates, minimum power load, number of major power cycles and emissions for these plants is sought in the future to complement renewables.},

 abstract = {This paper presents methods for design optimization and performance analysis of radial inflow turbines. Both methods are formulated in an equation-oriented manner and involve a single mathematical problem that is solved by an efficient, gradient-based optimization algorithm. In addition, the comparison of the model output with experimental data showed that the underlying mean-line flow model accurately predicts the variation of mass flow rate and isentropic efficiency as a function of the pressure ratio, rotational speed, and nozzle throat area. Moreover, the capabilities of the proposed methods were demonstrated by carrying out the preliminary design and performance prediction of the radial inflow turbine of an organic Rankine cycle. The results indicate that the design optimization method converges to the global optimum solution, regardless of the start values for the independent variables. In addition, the performance maps generated by the performance analysis method are physically consistent and agree with general findings from experimental data reported in the open literature. Considering the accuracy, robustness and low computational cost of the proposed methods, they can be regarded as a powerful tool for the preliminary design and performance prediction of radial inflow turbines, either as a standalone component or as part of a larger system. •New methods for design optimization and performance analysis of radial turbines.•The design optimization method reliably converges to the global optimum.•The analysis method predicts physically consistent performance maps.•Validation of the underlying mean-line model against experimental data.•Novel treatment of choked flow in the case of supersonic flow velocities.},

 abstract = {The prediction of turbomachinery performance characteristics is an important part of the conceptual aircraft engine design process. During this phase, the designer must examine the effects of a large number of turbomachinery design parameters to determine their impact on overall engine performance and weight. The lack of detailed design information available in this phase necessitates the use of simpler meanline and streamline methods to determine the turbomachinery geometry characteristics and provide performance estimates prior to more detailed CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analyses. While a number of analysis codes have been developed for this purpose, most are written in outdated software languages and may be difficult or impossible to apply to new, unconventional designs. The Object-Oriented Turbomachinery Analysis Code (OTAC) is currently being developed at NASA Glenn Research Center to provide a flexible meanline and streamline analysis capability in a modern object-oriented language. During the development and validation of OTAC, a limitation was identified in the code's ability to analyze and converge turbines as the flow approached choking. This paper describes a series of changes which can be made to typical OTAC turbine meanline models to enable the assessment of choked flow up to limit load conditions. Results produced with this revised model setup are provided in the form of turbine performance maps and are compared to published maps.},

 abstract = {Performance prediction of turbomachines is a significant part of aircraft propulsion design. In the conceptual design stage, there is an important need to quantify compressor and turbine aerodynamic performance and develop initial geometry parameters at the 2-D level prior to more extensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses. The Object-oriented Turbomachinery Analysis Code (OTAC) is being developed to perform 2-D meridional flowthrough analysis of turbomachines using an implicit formulation of the governing equations to solve for the conditions at the exit of each blade row. OTAC is designed to perform meanline or streamline calculations; for streamline analyses simple radial equilibrium is used as a governing equation to solve for spanwise property variations. While the goal for OTAC is to allow simulation of physical effects and architectural features unavailable in other existing codes, it must first prove capable of performing calculations for conventional turbomachines. OTAC is being developed using the interpreted language features available in the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) code described by Claus et al (1991). Using the NPSS framework came with several distinct advantages, including access to the pre-existing NPSS thermodynamic property packages and the NPSS Newton-Raphson solver. The remaining objects necessary for OTAC were written in the NPSS framework interpreted language. These new objects form the core of OTAC and are the BladeRow, BladeSegment, TransitionSection, Expander, Reducer, and OTACstart Elements. The BladeRow and BladeSegment consumed the initial bulk of the development effort and required determining the equations applicable to flow through turbomachinery blade rows given specific assumptions about the nature of that flow. Once these objects were completed, OTAC was tested and found to agree with existing solutions from other codes; these tests included various meanline and streamline comparisons of axial compressors and turbines at design and off-design conditions.},

 abstract = {This paper deals with handling of the cubic equation of state (CEOS) in equation-oriented (EO) process optimization. The roots of the CEOS are generally computed by subroutine-based calculations that involve logical if-else conditions. This approach can lead to nonsmoothness and convergence issues when used with gradient-based solvers in an EO framework. In this work, we propose a new general EO approach for selecting the appropriate root of the CEOS by incorporating derivative constraints specific to the desired (vapor or liquid) phase. We prove that these constraints are capable of isolating the liquid, middle and vapor root. The derivative constraints are tested using the EO phase-equilibrium formulation of Gopal and Biegler (1999) which is suitably extended for handling CEOS and relaxing the derivative constraints in the event of disappearance of phases. Using numerical examples involving simulation of flash vessels and optimization of distillation column, it is demonstrated that the proposed EO formulation always selects the appropriate roots, handles missing phases on distillation trays and flash units, and is fairly robust to different starting points in the phase envelopes.},

The aim of this study is the development of a new meanline FORTRAN code for accurate performance and loss assessment of VGTs under a wider operating range. This code is a useful alternative tool for engineers for fast design of VGT systems where higher efficiency and minimum loss are being required.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed meanline code was applied to a variable geometry mixed flow turbine at different nozzle vane angles and under a wide range of rotational speed and the expansion ratio. The numerical methodology was validated through a comparison of the predicted performance to test data. The maps of the mass flow rate as well as the efficiency of the VGT system are discussed for different nozzle vane angles under a wide range of rotational speed. Based on the developed model, a breakdown loss analysis was carried out showing a significant effect of the nozzle vane angle on the loss distribution.FindingsResults indicated that the nozzle angle of 70° has led to the maximum efficiency compared to the other investigated nozzle vane angles ranging from 30° up to 80°. The results showed that the passage loss was significantly reduced as the nozzle vane angle increases from 30° up to 70°.Originality/valueThis paper outlines a new meanline approach for variable geometry turbocharger turbines. The developed code presents the novelty of including the effect of the vane radii variation, due to the pivoting mechanism of the nozzle ring. The developed code can be generalized to either radial or mixed flow turbines with or without a VGT system.},

@inproceedings{kibsey_influence_2016,
 abstract = {The current profile loss prediction methods for axial turbine blades usually predict a monotonic increase in profile losses at outlet Mach numbers above 1.0, while linear cascade testing in the literature has revealed a more complex behaviour. An objective of this investigation was to help clarify the flow features that are most influential on the profile losses in the transonic and supersonic regimes. Four linear cascades of turbine blades were investigated both experimentally and computationally, at design incidence. Measurements were carried out over an outlet Mach number range of roughly 0.5 to 1.4, and a Reynolds number range of about 5 × 105 to 1.4×106.It was found that the profile losses of the four cascades exhibited a loss “plateau”, where the total pressure loss coefficient became approximately constant over a range of outlet Mach numbers spanning the low supersonic range. Cascades of different geometries exhibited different extents of this loss plateau, and a commonly used Mach number correction for profile losses did not capture the behaviour.In the literature, a relationship has been observed between the base pressure and the profile losses. The base pressure was linked to the losses in the trailing edge wake and in the trailing edge shock system. For this reason, base pressure data were obtained from blades instrumented with a static tap at the trailing edge, and also from computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results provided insight into the role of the base pressure in the profile losses through the transonic regime. It was concluded from this study that an accurate prediction of the base pressure may serve as a basis for a revised Mach number correction to be applied to the profile loss correlation in the transonic and supersonic flow regimes.},

@article{mallinson_part-load_1948,
 abstract = {The literature on the gas turbine already contains much information concerning the performance of the “constant-pressure” cycle both in its simple form and in its more complicated forms involving intercooled compression, reheated expansion, and heat exchange. Such information enables the design performance of a particular engine to be estimated, but there appears to be very little published work to help the designer to foretell what changes in performance are to be expected when particular engines operate at non-design conditions. What work there is seems to have been restricted to very simple engines, and is often further limited by the assumption of unalterable component performance characteristics.
In this lecture we attempt to include in a general comparison of part-load performance characteristics not only the simpler designs but also some of the more complex turbine engines which will be needed for land and marine applications. At the same time, by considering, in appropriate cases, the influence of changes in the assumed component performance features on the part-load operation of an engine, a broadening of the basis of comparison is made possible. As a result of the work we shall describe we feel that, although as yet so little of the possible field of investigation has been surveyed, it is nevertheless possible to indicate the main guiding principles by which the comparative part-load performance of different gas turbine schemes may be assessed.},

 abstract = {Modern power generation technologies, such as organic Rankine cycle power systems, require turboexpanders operating with high-efficiency and high power density. These features often lead to high-pressure ratios machines, characterised by the presence of choking and supersonic flow conditions. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for the preliminary design and performance prediction of radial-inflow turbines operating at high-pressure ratios. A steady-state, mean-line model of a radial-inflow turbine is developed including real-gas effects and a detailed modelling strategy for the treatment of choking flow conditions. In addition, a set of loss models tailored to high-pressure ratio radial-inflow turbines is developed. After a global sensitivity analysis, the model is calibrated by means of a multi-objective optimisation with a Genetic Algorithm and using the data of six high-pressure ratio turbines with total-to-total pressure ratios up to 5.8. The calibration method allows a significant reduction in the overall predicted deviation of the turbine isentropic efficiency and mass flow rate. The design model yields predicted deviations in isentropic efficiency within ± 3 \%-points and the off-design model within 5\%. The methodology and the results are intended to be used as a benchmark for the future development of radial-inflow turbines in high-pressure ratio applications. •A mean-line model for high-pressure ratio radial-inflow turbines is presented.•Modelling strategies for the treatment of choking conditions are detailed.•The loss models are calibrated with the experimental data of six turbines.•The calibration allowed reducing the deviation with the experimental data.•The mean-line model is validated with other two test cases within 5\% accuracy.},

 abstract = {Some of the key issues associated with the equation-oriented approach to process modelling and simulation are examined. It is argued that most processes and operations of industrial interest have combined discrete and continuous characteristics. Furthermore, effective tools for describing both the physical behaviour of process systems, and the external control actions and disturbances imposed on them are required. In both areas, major concerns include managing the complexity of real processes, and supporting the development of general components that can be re-used within a number of different applications. Recent work in this direction is reviewed. A general mathematical statement for the combined discrete and continuous dynamic simulation problem is presented, and the use of symbolic, structural and numerical solution techniques is discussed. Methods for the diagnosis of problems that are either badly-posed or difficult to solve with currently available methods are also considered. The areas of modelling distributed parameter systems, and supporting the formal description and solution of general optimisation problems are identified as being of strategic importance for the future evolution of general-purpose process modelling environments.},

 abstract = {Abstract. Decarbonization of energy systems is expected to require significant amounts of energy storage. Among the different technologies studied, thermo-mechanical storage is being considered for long duration storage due to its low cost and limited usage of critical materials. Based on the experience of pumped hydro plants, significant cost savings can be achieved if a single stage reversible compressor-turbine is used for both the charging and discharging of the storage. Due to the modest ({\textless} 4.5) pressure ratio involved, low temperature adiabatic compressed air energy storage and pumped thermal energy storage are considered as candidate applications for reversible turbomachinery.This paper presents a numerical analysis of an existing high efficiency centrifugal compressor operating both as a compressor and a turbine using mean-line analysis and steady-state simulations with Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations in ANSYS CFX. After validation against experimental data in compressor operating mode, the turbine mode was tested by changing only the inlet and outlet boundary conditions and reversing the direction of rotation. Subsequently, a new stage was designed using conventional procedures developed for compressors and evaluated using computational fluid dynamics simulations.The results indicate that for an up-scaled version of the existing compressor it is possible to reach total-to-total polytropic efficiencies exceeding 86.7\% as a compressor and 92.1\% as a turbine, which is comparable with the efficiencies of dedicated machines. The new design reaches a polytropic efficiency of 89.4\% as compressor and 90.4\% as turbine. In both cases the numbers obtained do not include a volute or diffuser cone. Furthermore, the results indicate that there is a compromise between the optimal design for the compressor and turbine mode.},

 abstract = {Abstract. The objective of this paper is to assess the thermo-economic performance of different cycle configurations for pumped thermal electricity storage (PTES), including the effects of charging electricity cost. Reversible turbomachinery is employed to reduce the capital cost. Brayton cycles with different working fluids and a subcritical Rankine cycle operating with ammonia are compared. Liquid thermal energy storage systems are used. For the Brayton cycle, also packed bed storage systems are considered as an alternative.A new cost correlation for turbomachines, initially developed for organic Rankine cycles, is adapted for compressors and reversible machines. This correlation is based on the number of stages and physical size of the machine, which are estimated considering thermodynamic as well as mechanical limitations on the enthalpy difference that can be attained per stage.The results indicate that for a plant size of 50 MW and a discharge duration of 8 hours, the Brayton system with liquid storage and helium as a working fluid has the lowest levelized cost of storage at 0.138 \$/kWh, mainly due to the high thermal conductivity of the fluid. Packed bed systems were found to be more expensive than liquid storage systems due to the large cost of the pressure vessels, with cost parity reached at a discharge duration of 4 hours. However, at this duration lithium ion batteries are likely to be cheaper. The results suggest that the levelized cost of storage for the Rankine cycle is slightly higher, 0.151 \$/kWh. In addition, the Rankine cycle has disadvantages related to the higher storage volume and less flexibility for part load operation.},

 abstract = {Organic rankine cycles (ORC) are renowned to be attractive energy conversion systems for the thermal energy sources in the small-to-medium power range. A critical component in the ORC technology is the turbo-expander; the difficulties involved in the accurate thermodynamic modeling of organic fluids and, especially, the complex gasdynamic phenomena that are commonly found in ORC turbines may result in relatively low efficiency and in performance reduction at partial loads. In this perspective, a relevant path of development can be outlined in the evaluation of nonconventional turbine architectures, such as the radial-outward or centrifugal turbine. In the present work, a critical evaluation of the feasibility of multistage transonic centrifugal turbines for ORC systems is presented. To support this study, a two-step design procedure, specifically oriented to ORC turbines, was developed. The methodology includes a 1D mean-line code coupled to an external optimizer to perform a preliminary design of the machine. The selected configurations are then verified with a CFD (computational fluid dynamics)-based throughflow solver, able to deal with any flow regime and to treat fluids described by arbitrary equations of state. The overall procedure is applied to the design of two different turbines of the same target power of about 1 MW, the former representing a transonic six-stage turbine and the latter a supersonic three-stage turbine. The two machines are characterized by very different shape and comparable performances. The results are extensively discussed in terms of both overall data and detailed flow fields.},

 abstract = {•S-CO2 flow through nozzle is theoretically analyzed with six different EOSs.•The flow properties predicted with real gas EOS is compared with ideal gas EOS.•The flow field inside the shock wave is also analyzed with real gas effects.•The influence of thermodynamic models choice in the S-CO2 flow modeling is analyzed. Supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) has a density as high as that of its liquid phase while the viscosity remains closer to its gaseous phase. S-CO2 has the potential to be used as a working fluid in compressor as it requires much less work due to its low compressibility as well as relatively small flow resistance. Besides the material properties and design calculations, the thermodynamic properties of working gases play a vital role in the design and efficiency of various machinery such as compressors, turbines, etc. Equation of state (EOS) which accounts the real gas effects is used in computational analysis to estimates the thermodynamic properties of the working fluid. Each EOS gives priority to real gas effects phenomena differently and for the analysis of the fluid dynamic machinery, as of today, there is no standard procedure for selecting a suitable equation of state (EOS). To understand the influence of real gas effects on the formation of a shock wave, S-CO2 flow through a convergent-divergent nozzle, is theoretically analyzed. The thermophysical and transport properties calculated with the six different equation of state (EOS) are used to estimate the flow characteristics. An in-house code based on the real gas approach which solves gas dynamics equations with variable gas properties is used to analytically analyze the compressible flow of S-CO2 through nozzle. The solution for the shock strength, total pressure loss, and location of the normal shock wave at different back pressure conditions is obtained. Using Becker’s solutions with varying viscosity and thermal conductivity estimated from each EOS, the properties inside the normal shock wave are calculated. Numerical results of supersonic S-CO2 flow varies with different EOS candidates and the formation of shock wave is found to be significantly influenced by the real gas effects.},

 abstract = {The development of advanced computational fluid dynamic codes for turbine design does not substitute the importance of mean-line codes. Turbine design involves mean-line design, through-flow design, airfoil design, and finally 3D viscous modeling. The preliminary mean-line design continues to play an important role in early design stages. The aim of this paper was to present the methodology of mean-line designing of axial turbines and to discuss the computational methods and procedures used. The paper presents the Lund University Axial Turbine mean-line code (LUAX-T). LUAX-T is a reduced-order through-flow tool that is capable of designing highly loaded, cooled axial turbines. The stage computation consists of three iteration loops — cooling, entropy, and geometry iteration loop. The stage convergence method depends on whether the stage is part of the compressor turbine (CT) or power turbine (PT) stages, final CT stage, or final PT stage. LUAX-T was developed to design axial single- and twin-shaft turbines, and various working fluid and fuel compositions can be specified. LUAX-T uses the modified Ainley and Mathieson loss model, with the cooling computation based on the m*-model. Turbine geometries were established by applying various geometry correlations and methods. The validation was performed against a test turbine that was part of a European turbine development program. LUAX-T validated the axial PT of the test turbine, which consisted of two stages with rotational speed 13000 rpm. LUAX-T showed good agreement with the available performance data on the test turbine. The paper presented also the mean-line design of an axial cooled twin-shaft turbine. Design parameters were kept within limits of current practice. The total turbine power was 109 MW, of which the CT power was 55 MW. The CT was designed with two stages with a rotational speed of 9500 rpm, while the PT had two stages with a rotational speed of 6200 rpm. The total cooling mass flow was calculated to 31 kg/s, which corresponds to 23 \% of compressor inlet mass flow. LUAX-T proved capable of designing uncooled and cooled turbines.},

Mean-line (one-dimensional) analysis is one of the solutions that is computationally cost-effective along with producing accurate results. However, the development of a mean-line model that able to solve the flow in a choked turbine (one-row chocking and multi-row choking) is a challenging problem. This study presents a new algorithm for mean-line analysis of axial flow turbines with a set of well-posed boundary conditions, i.e., the inlet total pressure, the inlet total temperature, inlet flow angle, and outlet static pressure and calculates the flow condition through the turbine row-by-row. The proposed algorithm is implemented in an object-oriented C++ code named Axial Turbine Simulator (ATSim). The results of ATSim program is validated and verified under various working conditions, e.g., low and high-pressure ratios (choking condition), for four different turbine configurations including two uncooled single-stage turbines, an uncooled two-stage turbine, and a cooled three-stage turbine. ATSim provide good consistency with previous experimental and numerical studies. Moreover, the results show that ATSim is capable of estimating the performance of the turbine in a very short time over a wide range of working conditions, including choking (one-row choking or multi-row choking) region. •An efficient and real-time mean-line analysis of axial turbines is proposed.•The algorithm employed a well-posed set of boundary conditions, i.e.: pt,in, Tt,in, αin, ps,out.•The performance of turbines in a wide range of working conditions can be estimated.•The effect of blade film cooling is considered in the algorithm.•Results indicate good consistency with previous experimental and numerical studies.},

 abstract = {Paradigmatic compressible one-dimensional flows provide insights regarding the loss mechanisms of fluid machinery components typical of power and propulsion systems, like turbomachines and heat exchangers. Their performance also depends on the working fluid, thus, on both molecular complexity and thermodynamic state. Four typical flow configurations have been investigated, namely, Rayleigh and Fanno flows, mixing of two co-flowing streams, and flow injection into a mainstream. It was found that the Grüneisen parameter allows the quantitative characterization of the influence of molecular complexity on losses. Moreover, the influence of dense vapor effects has been evaluated and assessed in terms of other fluid parameters. The analysis allowed the quantification of how, in Rayleigh flows, the energy transferred as heat is converted into kinetic and internal energy of the fluid, and, in Fanno flows, entropy is generated due to friction. In Rayleigh flow, the fluid at the inlet of the channel must have more energy for the flow to choke, depending on the molecular complexity. Similarly, in Fanno flows and for a given value of the compressibility factor, molecular complexity determines the choking point in the channel, and the higher its value the further downstream is the location. Moreover, for both Fanno and Rayleigh flows, if the flow is subsonic and dense vapor effects are relevant, the Mach number varies non-monotonically along the channel. Finally, it was proven that the amount of entropy generated in mixing flows increases with both the fluid molecular complexity and with the thermodynamic non-ideality of the fluid states.},

Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of transitional, zero-pressure gradient boundary layer flows are performed for two fluids characterized by different complexity of the fluid molecules, namely, “air” and siloxane MM. Different sets of thermodynamic free-stream boundary conditions are selected to evaluate the influence of the fluid state on both the frictional loss and the dissipation mechanisms. The thermophysical properties of siloxane MM are calculated with a state-of-the-art equation of state. Results show that the dissipation due to both time-mean strain field, irreversible heat transfer, and turbulent dissipation differs significantly depending on both the molecular complexity of the fluid and its thermodynamic state. The dissipation coefficient calculated from the DNS results is then compared against the one obtained using a reduced-order model (ROM), which solves the two-dimensional boundary layer flow equations for an arbitrary fluid [M.

In this study, as the first stage to investigate the aerodynamic performance of an ultra-highly loaded turbine cascade (UHLTC) with a turning angle of 160 degrees at transonic flow regime, two-dimensional steady compressible flows in UHLTC were analyzed numerically by using a commercial CFD code to focus on the profile loss. In the computations, the isentropic exit Mach number was varied in the wide range from 0.3 to 1.8 in order to examine the effects of exit Mach number on the shock wave formation and the associated profile loss generation. The computed results were examined in detail by comparing with those for a typical transonic turbine cascade. The detailed examination for the present computed results clarified the variation of shock pattern with the increase of exit Mach number and the loss “plateau” behavior in the present UHLTC.},

 abstract = {Compressed air energy storage (CAES) system is an “electricity to electricity” device. To reveal the energy conversion process and understand the energy loss principle are critical to improve the energy conversion efﬁciency. In this paper, the charge/discharge process analysis of an axial turbine based CAES with constant volume is executed in constant turbine inlet pressure mode and variable turbine inlet pressure mode. Firstly, the energy efﬁciency analysis of a whole round trip cycle of CAES system under design condition is carried out. The second law efﬁciencies of the operation mode 1 and the operation mode 2 are 44.56\% and 45.16\%, respectively. It also can be found that the throttling loss in operation mode 1 can be offset by the beneﬁts of higher isentropic efﬁciency of turbines. Then, the off-design analysis of these two operation modes is implemented by considering the different power levels and speed levels. The mass ﬂow rates of working ﬂuids across the expansion train both increase with the increased load rate or the decreased speed. The load rate or speed both have the positive effect on the exergy efﬁciency and the energy generated per unit volume of storage, but have the negative effect on the heat rate.},
