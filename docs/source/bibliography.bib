@misc{anderson_method_2022,
 abstract = {Today, expanders for Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) are either inefficient or expensive. One reason for this is that expanders of power conversion systems usually operate under different conditions over an annual perspective. Still, they are designed to perform best at a single operating point. In view of this limitation, it is suggested that the overall expander performance can be improved by taking into account off-design operation in the design process. As the first step in this direction, this paper presents a two-fold method for design optimization and performance analysis of one-stage axial turbines. The method utilizes the same mean-line model for performance analysis and design optimization, ensuring consistency between the two modes. In addition, the proposed method evaluates the turbine performance at three stations for each blade row: inlet, throat and exit, and employs a novel numerical treatment of flow choking that automatically determines which blade rows are choked as part of the solution. Furthermore, the method was validated against cold-air experimental data from three different one-stage axial turbines, at both on- and off-design conditions. The model predicts design point efficiencies between 1.1 and 4.5 percentage points off the experimental values. The model was also able to capture the trend of mass flow rate as a function of total-to-static pressure ratio and angular speed. However, an unphysical behavior was observed as the pressure ratio approaches the critical value, and further developments of the model are required. It is envisioned that the proposed method will serve as foundation for a robust design methodology that will enable higher expander performance over a range of operating conditions.},

@article{colonna_organic_2015,
 abstract = {The cumulative global capacity of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems for the conversion of renewable and waste thermal energy is undergoing a rapid growth and is estimated to be approx. 2000 MWe considering only installations that went into operation after 1995. The potential for the conversion of the thermal power coming from liquid-dominated geothermal reservoirs, waste heat from primary engines or industrial processes, biomass combustion, and concentrated solar radiation into electricity is arguably enormous. ORC technology is possibly the most flexible in terms of capacity and temperature level and is currently often the only applicable technology for the conversion of external thermal energy sources. In addition, ORC power systems are suitable for the cogeneration of heating and/or cooling, another advantage in the framework of distributed power generation. Related research and development is therefore very lively. These considerations motivated the effort documented in this article, aimed at providing consistent information about the evolution, state, and future of this power conversion technology. First, basic theoretical elements on the thermodynamic cycle, working fluid, and design aspects are illustrated, together with an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages in comparison to competing technologies. An overview of the long history of the development of ORC power systems follows, in order to place the more recent evolution into perspective. Then, a compendium of the many aspects of the state of the art is illustrated: the solutions currently adopted in commercial plants and the main-stream applications, including information about exemplary installations. A classification and terminology for ORC power plants are proposed. An outlook on the many research and development activities is provided, whereby information on new high-impact applications, such as automotive heat recovery is included. Possible directions of future developments are highlighted, ranging from efforts targeting volume-produced stationary and mobile mini-ORC systems with a power output of few kW(e), up to large MWe base-load ORC plants.},

Airbreathing turbine engines provide jet and turboshaft propulsion, as well as auxiliary power for aircraft. Propellant-driven turbines provide rocket propulsion and auxiliary power for spacecraft. Closed-cycle turbine engines using inert gases, organic fluids, and metal fluids have been studied for providing long-duration electric power for spacecraft. Other applications of interest for turbine engines include land-vehicle (cars, trucks, buses, trains, etc.) propulsion power and ground-based electrical power. In view of the turbine-system interest and efforts at Lewis Research Center, a course entitled 'Turbine Design and Application' was presented during 1968-69 as part of the In-house Graduate Study Program. The course was somewhat revised and again presented in 1972-73. Various aspects of turbine technology were covered including thermodynamic and fluid-dynamic concepts, fundamental turbine concepts, velocity diagrams, losses, blade aerodynamic design, blade cooling, mechanical design, operation, and performance. The notes written and used for the course have been revised and edited for publication. Such a publication can serve as a foundation for an introductory turbine course, a means for self-study, or a reference for selected topics. Any consistent set of units will satisfy the equations presented. Two commonly used consistent sets of units and constant values are given after the symbol definitions. These are the SI units and the U.S. customary units. A single set of equations covers both sets of units by including all constants required for the U.S. customary units and defining as unity those not required for the SI units.

Both methods are formulated in an equation-oriented manner and involve a single mathematical problem that is solved by an efficient, gradient-based optimization algorithm. In addition, the comparison of the model output with experimental data showed that the underlying mean-line flow model accurately predicts the variation of mass flow rate and isentropic efficiency as a function of the pressure ratio, rotational speed, and nozzle throat area. Moreover, the capabilities of the proposed methods were demonstrated by carrying out the preliminary design and performance prediction of the radial inflow turbine of an organic Rankine cycle. The results indicate that the design optimization method converges to the global optimum solution, regardless of the start values for the independent variables. In addition, the performance maps generated by the performance analysis method are physically consistent and agree with general findings from experimental data reported in the open literature. Considering the accuracy, robustness and low computational cost of the proposed methods, they can be regarded as a powerful tool for the preliminary design and performance prediction of radial inflow turbines, either as a standalone component or as part of a larger system. •New methods for design optimization and performance analysis of radial turbines.•The design optimization method reliably converges to the global optimum.•The analysis method predicts physically consistent performance maps.•Validation of the underlying mean-line model against experimental data.•Novel treatment of choked flow in the case of supersonic flow velocities.},

@inproceedings{hendricks_meanline_2016,
 abstract = {The prediction of turbomachinery performance characteristics is an important part of the conceptual aircraft engine design process. During this phase, the designer must examine the effects of a large number of turbomachinery design parameters to determine their impact on overall engine performance and weight. The lack of detailed design information available in this phase necessitates the use of simpler meanline and streamline methods to determine the turbomachinery geometry characteristics and provide performance estimates prior to more detailed CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analyses. While a number of analysis codes have been developed for this purpose, most are written in outdated software languages and may be difficult or impossible to apply to new, unconventional designs. The Object-Oriented Turbomachinery Analysis Code (OTAC) is currently being developed at NASA Glenn Research Center to provide a flexible meanline and streamline analysis capability in a modern object-oriented language. During the development and validation of OTAC, a limitation was identified in the code's ability to analyze and converge turbines as the flow approached choking. This paper describes a series of changes which can be made to typical OTAC turbine meanline models to enable the assessment of choked flow up to limit load conditions. Results produced with this revised model setup are provided in the form of turbine performance maps and are compared to published maps.},

 abstract = {Modern power generation technologies, such as organic Rankine cycle power systems, require turboexpanders operating with high-efficiency and high power density. These features often lead to high-pressure ratios machines, characterised by the presence of choking and supersonic flow conditions. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for the preliminary design and performance prediction of radial-inflow turbines operating at high-pressure ratios. A steady-state, mean-line model of a radial-inflow turbine is developed including real-gas effects and a detailed modelling strategy for the treatment of choking flow conditions. In addition, a set of loss models tailored to high-pressure ratio radial-inflow turbines is developed. After a global sensitivity analysis, the model is calibrated by means of a multi-objective optimisation with a Genetic Algorithm and using the data of six high-pressure ratio turbines with total-to-total pressure ratios up to 5.8. The calibration method allows a significant reduction in the overall predicted deviation of the turbine isentropic efficiency and mass flow rate. The design model yields predicted deviations in isentropic efficiency within ± 3 \%-points and the off-design model within 5\%. The methodology and the results are intended to be used as a benchmark for the future development of radial-inflow turbines in high-pressure ratio applications. •A mean-line model for high-pressure ratio radial-inflow turbines is presented.•Modelling strategies for the treatment of choking conditions are detailed.•The loss models are calibrated with the experimental data of six turbines.•The calibration allowed reducing the deviation with the experimental data.•The mean-line model is validated with other two test cases within 5\% accuracy.},

 abstract = {Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) are one of the most notable methods for waste heat recovery at low to medium temperatures which leads to a cleaner environment. Organic vapors with high molecular weight are the working fluid of the ORC. Using such substances leads to non-ideal or non-classical gas dynamics inside the expander, where transonic and supersonic regimes occur. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the literature related to the real-gas effects with applications of ORCs. The review includes numerical simulations and experimental approaches. It is shown that the main gap in this field is quantitative experimental results for the flow field. However, recently a free jet of such flows investigated by particle image velocimetry but, this experiment is done for a specific substance. Therefore, a number of research opportunity in this field will be remained for future studies. •An extensive review has been made on the real-gas effects with application in ORC.•Real-gas effects have been discussed with the effects on ORC expanders.•Both numerical and experimental approach have been investigated.•There is a lack of quantitative results for CFD simulation validation.•Experimental line is still open for further investigation.},

 abstract = {•S-CO2 flow through nozzle is theoretically analyzed with six different EOSs.•The flow properties predicted with real gas EOS is compared with ideal gas EOS.•The flow field inside the shock wave is also analyzed with real gas effects.•The influence of thermodynamic models choice in the S-CO2 flow modeling is analyzed. Supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) has a density as high as that of its liquid phase while the viscosity remains closer to its gaseous phase. S-CO2 has the potential to be used as a working fluid in compressor as it requires much less work due to its low compressibility as well as relatively small flow resistance. Besides the material properties and design calculations, the thermodynamic properties of working gases play a vital role in the design and efficiency of various machinery such as compressors, turbines, etc. Equation of state (EOS) which accounts the real gas effects is used in computational analysis to estimates the thermodynamic properties of the working fluid. Each EOS gives priority to real gas effects phenomena differently and for the analysis of the fluid dynamic machinery, as of today, there is no standard procedure for selecting a suitable equation of state (EOS). To understand the influence of real gas effects on the formation of a shock wave, S-CO2 flow through a convergent-divergent nozzle, is theoretically analyzed. The thermophysical and transport properties calculated with the six different equation of state (EOS) are used to estimate the flow characteristics. An in-house code based on the real gas approach which solves gas dynamics equations with variable gas properties is used to analytically analyze the compressible flow of S-CO2 through nozzle. The solution for the shock strength, total pressure loss, and location of the normal shock wave at different back pressure conditions is obtained. Using Becker’s solutions with varying viscosity and thermal conductivity estimated from each EOS, the properties inside the normal shock wave are calculated. Numerical results of supersonic S-CO2 flow varies with different EOS candidates and the formation of shock wave is found to be significantly influenced by the real gas effects.},

 abstract = {Development of a fast and accurate tool to estimate the performance of axial flow turbines in all range of working conditions including choked region is of great interest in the design steps of turbines. Mean-line (one-dimensional) analysis is one of the solutions that is computationally cost-effective along with producing accurate results. However, the development of a mean-line model that able to solve the flow in a choked turbine (one-row chocking and multi-row choking) is a challenging problem. This study presents a new algorithm for mean-line analysis of axial flow turbines with a set of well-posed boundary conditions, i.e., the inlet total pressure, the inlet total temperature, inlet flow angle, and outlet static pressure and calculates the flow condition through the turbine row-by-row. The proposed algorithm is implemented in an object-oriented C++ code named Axial Turbine Simulator (ATSim). The results of ATSim program is validated and verified under various working conditions, e.g., low and high-pressure ratios (choking condition), for four different turbine configurations including two uncooled single-stage turbines, an uncooled two-stage turbine, and a cooled three-stage turbine. ATSim provide good consistency with previous experimental and numerical studies. Moreover, the results show that ATSim is capable of estimating the performance of the turbine in a very short time over a wide range of working conditions, including choking (one-row choking or multi-row choking) region. •An efficient and real-time mean-line analysis of axial turbines is proposed.•The algorithm employed a well-posed set of boundary conditions, i.e.: pt,in, Tt,in, αin, ps,out.•The performance of turbines in a wide range of working conditions can be estimated.•The effect of blade film cooling is considered in the algorithm.•Results indicate good consistency with previous experimental and numerical studies.},
