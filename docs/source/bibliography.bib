@misc{anderson_method_2022,
 abstract = {Today, expanders for Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) are either inefficient or expensive. One reason for this is that expanders of power conversion systems usually operate under different conditions over an annual perspective. Still, they are designed to perform best at a single operating point. In view of this limitation, it is suggested that the overall expander performance can be improved by taking into account off-design operation in the design process. As the first step in this direction, this paper presents a two-fold method for design optimization and performance analysis of one-stage axial turbines. The method utilizes the same mean-line model for performance analysis and design optimization, ensuring consistency between the two modes. In addition, the proposed method evaluates the turbine performance at three stations for each blade row: inlet, throat and exit, and employs a novel numerical treatment of flow choking that automatically determines which blade rows are choked as part of the solution. Furthermore, the method was validated against cold-air experimental data from three different one-stage axial turbines, at both on- and off-design conditions. The model predicts design point efficiencies between 1.1 and 4.5 percentage points off the experimental values. The model was also able to capture the trend of mass flow rate as a function of total-to-static pressure ratio and angular speed. However, an unphysical behavior was observed as the pressure ratio approaches the critical value, and further developments of the model are required. It is envisioned that the proposed method will serve as foundation for a robust design methodology that will enable higher expander performance over a range of operating conditions.},

 abstract = {A Users’ Guide for the axial flow turbine off-design computer program AXOD2 is composed. This Users’ Guide is supplementary to the original Users’ Manual of AXOD. Three notable contributions of AXOD2 to its predecessor AXOD, both in the context of the Guide or in the functionality of the code, are described and discussed in length. These are: 1) a rational representation of the mathematical principles applied, with concise descriptions of the formulas implemented in the actual coding. Their physical implications are addressed; 2) the creation and documentation of an ‘Addendum Listing’ of input namelist-parameters unique to AXOD2, that differ from or are in addition to the original input-namelists given in the Manual of AXOD. Their usages are discussed; and 3) the institution of proper stoppages of the code execution, encoding termination messaging and error messages of the execution to AXOD2. These measures are to safe-guard the integrity of the code execution, such that a failure mode encountered during a case-study would not plunge the code execution into indefinite loop, or cause a blow-out of the program execution. Details on these are discussed and illustrated in this paper. Moreover, this computer program has since been reconstructed substantially. Standard FORTRAN Langue was instituted, and the code was formatted in Double Precision (REAL*8). As the result, the code is now suited for use in a local Desktop Computer Environment, is perfectly portable to any Operating System, and can be executed by any FORTRAN compiler equivalent to a FORTRAN 90/95 compiler. AXOD2 will be available through NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) Software Repository.},

TD2-2 employs a streamline curvature method for design, while AXOD approaches the flow analysis with an equal radius-height domain decomposition strategy. Both methods resolve only the flows in the annulus region while modeling the impact introduced by the blade rows. The mathematical formulations and derivations involved in both methods are documented in references 3, 4 (for TD2-2) and in reference 5 (for AXOD). The focus of this paper is to discuss the fundamental issues of applicability and compatibility of the two codes as a pair of companion pieces, to perform preliminary design and off-design analysis for modern aircraft engine turbines. Two validation cases for the design and the off-design prediction using TD2-2 and AXOD conducted on two existing high efficiency turbines, developed and tested in the NASA/GE Energy Efficient Engine (GE-E3) Program, the High Pressure Turbine (HPT; two stages, air cooled) and the Low Pressure Turbine (LPT; five stages, un-cooled), are provided in support of the analysis and discussion presented in this paper.},

@article{colonna_organic_2015,
 abstract = {The cumulative global capacity of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems for the conversion of renewable and waste thermal energy is undergoing a rapid growth and is estimated to be approx. 2000 MWe considering only installations that went into operation after 1995. The potential for the conversion of the thermal power coming from liquid-dominated geothermal reservoirs, waste heat from primary engines or industrial processes, biomass combustion, and concentrated solar radiation into electricity is arguably enormous. ORC technology is possibly the most flexible in terms of capacity and temperature level and is currently often the only applicable technology for the conversion of external thermal energy sources. In addition, ORC power systems are suitable for the cogeneration of heating and/or cooling, another advantage in the framework of distributed power generation. Related research and development is therefore very lively. These considerations motivated the effort documented in this article, aimed at providing consistent information about the evolution, state, and future of this power conversion technology. First, basic theoretical elements on the thermodynamic cycle, working fluid, and design aspects are illustrated, together with an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages in comparison to competing technologies. An overview of the long history of the development of ORC power systems follows, in order to place the more recent evolution into perspective. Then, a compendium of the many aspects of the state of the art is illustrated: the solutions currently adopted in commercial plants and the main-stream applications, including information about exemplary installations. A classification and terminology for ORC power plants are proposed. An outlook on the many research and development activities is provided, whereby information on new high-impact applications, such as automotive heat recovery is included. Possible directions of future developments are highlighted, ranging from efforts targeting volume-produced stationary and mobile mini-ORC systems with a power output of few kW(e), up to large MWe base-load ORC plants.},

 abstract = {The profile shape of an axial turbine blade is required to satisfy both aerodynamic and mechanical criteria; the designer wants the most favorable velocity distribution achievable with the permissible blade thickness. The design involves some trial-and-error, especially if the profile is initially prescribed by solely aerodynamic or solely mechanical requirements. A new design technique is described in which both aerodynamic and mechanical requirements are prescribed. The shape is defined by an algebraic function of eight parameters: blade inlet and outlet angle, maximum thickness, trailing edge thickness and wedge angle, leading edge radius, and the points of maximum thickness and maximum camber. Some of these are chosen to satisfy mechanical requirements, and curves are given recommending the best values of the remaining parameters from aerodynamic considerations, with the exception of the position of maximum camber. By varying that over a narrow range, a good shape can quickly be selected. A computer program for designing blades this way and analyzing blades designed in other ways is described.},

Other applications of interest for turbine engines include land-vehicle (cars, trucks, buses, trains, etc.) propulsion power and ground-based electrical power. In view of the turbine-system interest and efforts at Lewis Research Center, a course entitled 'Turbine Design and Application' was presented during 1968-69 as part of the In-house Graduate Study Program. The course was somewhat revised and again presented in 1972-73. Various aspects of turbine technology were covered including thermodynamic and fluid-dynamic concepts, fundamental turbine concepts, velocity diagrams, losses, blade aerodynamic design, blade cooling, mechanical design, operation, and performance. The notes written and used for the course have been revised and edited for publication. Such a publication can serve as a foundation for an introductory turbine course, a means for self-study, or a reference for selected topics. Any consistent set of units will satisfy the equations presented. Two commonly used consistent sets of units and constant values are given after the symbol definitions.

Both methods are formulated in an equation-oriented manner and involve a single mathematical problem that is solved by an efficient, gradient-based optimization algorithm. In addition, the comparison of the model output with experimental data showed that the underlying mean-line flow model accurately predicts the variation of mass flow rate and isentropic efficiency as a function of the pressure ratio, rotational speed, and nozzle throat area. Moreover, the capabilities of the proposed methods were demonstrated by carrying out the preliminary design and performance prediction of the radial inflow turbine of an organic Rankine cycle. The results indicate that the design optimization method converges to the global optimum solution, regardless of the start values for the independent variables. In addition, the performance maps generated by the performance analysis method are physically consistent and agree with general findings from experimental data reported in the open literature. Considering the accuracy, robustness and low computational cost of the proposed methods, they can be regarded as a powerful tool for the preliminary design and performance prediction of radial inflow turbines, either as a standalone component or as part of a larger system. •New methods for design optimization and performance analysis of radial turbines.•The design optimization method reliably converges to the global optimum.•The analysis method predicts physically consistent performance maps.•Validation of the underlying mean-line model against experimental data.•Novel treatment of choked flow in the case of supersonic flow velocities.},

 abstract = {The prediction of turbomachinery performance characteristics is an important part of the conceptual aircraft engine design process. During this phase, the designer must examine the effects of a large number of turbomachinery design parameters to determine their impact on overall engine performance and weight. The lack of detailed design information available in this phase necessitates the use of simpler meanline and streamline methods to determine the turbomachinery geometry characteristics and provide performance estimates prior to more detailed CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analyses. While a number of analysis codes have been developed for this purpose, most are written in outdated software languages and may be difficult or impossible to apply to new, unconventional designs. The Object-Oriented Turbomachinery Analysis Code (OTAC) is currently being developed at NASA Glenn Research Center to provide a flexible meanline and streamline analysis capability in a modern object-oriented language. During the development and validation of OTAC, a limitation was identified in the code's ability to analyze and converge turbines as the flow approached choking. This paper describes a series of changes which can be made to typical OTAC turbine meanline models to enable the assessment of choked flow up to limit load conditions. Results produced with this revised model setup are provided in the form of turbine performance maps and are compared to published maps.},

In one-dimensional modeling, the loss models have to be used to determine the entropy increase across each section of axial turbines stage at both the design and off-design conditions.The calculation used in this modeling is based on common thermodynamics and aerodynamics principles in a mean stream line analysis.Finally, in order to have a better understanding of the loss models behavior and verify the suggested algorithm accuracy, the analytical results from modeling were compared with experimental results and the comparison shows that good adaptation is obtained.},

@article{mallinson_part-load_1948,
 abstract = {The literature on the gas turbine already contains much information concerning the performance of the “constant-pressure” cycle both in its simple form and in its more complicated forms involving intercooled compression, reheated expansion, and heat exchange. Such information enables the design performance of a particular engine to be estimated, but there appears to be very little published work to help the designer to foretell what changes in performance are to be expected when particular engines operate at non-design conditions. What work there is seems to have been restricted to very simple engines, and is often further limited by the assumption of unalterable component performance characteristics. In this lecture we attempt to include in a general comparison of part-load performance characteristics not only the simpler designs but also some of the more complex turbine engines which will be needed for land and marine applications. At the same time, by considering, in appropriate cases, the influence of changes in the assumed component performance features on the part-load operation of an engine, a broadening of the basis of comparison is made possible. As a result of the work we shall describe we feel that, although as yet so little of the possible field of investigation has been surveyed, it is nevertheless possible to indicate the main guiding principles by which the comparative part-load performance of different gas turbine schemes may be assessed.},

@article{meroni_methodology_2018,
 abstract = {Modern power generation technologies, such as organic Rankine cycle power systems, require turboexpanders operating with high-efficiency and high power density. These features often lead to high-pressure ratios machines, characterised by the presence of choking and supersonic flow conditions. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for the preliminary design and performance prediction of radial-inflow turbines operating at high-pressure ratios. A steady-state, mean-line model of a radial-inflow turbine is developed including real-gas effects and a detailed modelling strategy for the treatment of choking flow conditions. In addition, a set of loss models tailored to high-pressure ratio radial-inflow turbines is developed. After a global sensitivity analysis, the model is calibrated by means of a multi-objective optimisation with a Genetic Algorithm and using the data of six high-pressure ratio turbines with total-to-total pressure ratios up to 5.8. The calibration method allows a significant reduction in the overall predicted deviation of the turbine isentropic efficiency and mass flow rate. The design model yields predicted deviations in isentropic efficiency within ± 3 \%-points and the off-design model within 5\%. The methodology and the results are intended to be used as a benchmark for the future development of radial-inflow turbines in high-pressure ratio applications. •A mean-line model for high-pressure ratio radial-inflow turbines is presented.•Modelling strategies for the treatment of choking conditions are detailed.•The loss models are calibrated with the experimental data of six turbines.•The calibration allowed reducing the deviation with the experimental data.•The mean-line model is validated with other two test cases within 5\% accuracy.},

 abstract = {•S-CO2 flow through nozzle is theoretically analyzed with six different EOSs.•The flow properties predicted with real gas EOS is compared with ideal gas EOS.•The flow field inside the shock wave is also analyzed with real gas effects.•The influence of thermodynamic models choice in the S-CO2 flow modeling is analyzed. Supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) has a density as high as that of its liquid phase while the viscosity remains closer to its gaseous phase. S-CO2 has the potential to be used as a working fluid in compressor as it requires much less work due to its low compressibility as well as relatively small flow resistance. Besides the material properties and design calculations, the thermodynamic properties of working gases play a vital role in the design and efficiency of various machinery such as compressors, turbines, etc. Equation of state (EOS) which accounts the real gas effects is used in computational analysis to estimates the thermodynamic properties of the working fluid. Each EOS gives priority to real gas effects phenomena differently and for the analysis of the fluid dynamic machinery, as of today, there is no standard procedure for selecting a suitable equation of state (EOS). To understand the influence of real gas effects on the formation of a shock wave, S-CO2 flow through a convergent-divergent nozzle, is theoretically analyzed. The thermophysical and transport properties calculated with the six different equation of state (EOS) are used to estimate the flow characteristics. An in-house code based on the real gas approach which solves gas dynamics equations with variable gas properties is used to analytically analyze the compressible flow of S-CO2 through nozzle. The solution for the shock strength, total pressure loss, and location of the normal shock wave at different back pressure conditions is obtained. Using Becker’s solutions with varying viscosity and thermal conductivity estimated from each EOS, the properties inside the normal shock wave are calculated. Numerical results of supersonic S-CO2 flow varies with different EOS candidates and the formation of shock wave is found to be significantly influenced by the real gas effects.},

However, even if turbine maps are available, efficiency and mass flow characteristics span over a limited range of pressure ratio, due to limitations of conventional T/C test benches.

 abstract = {The development of advanced computational fluid dynamic codes for turbine design does not substitute the importance of mean-line codes. Turbine design involves mean-line design, through-flow design, airfoil design, and finally 3D viscous modeling. The preliminary mean-line design continues to play an important role in early design stages. The aim of this paper was to present the methodology of mean-line designing of axial turbines and to discuss the computational methods and procedures used. The paper presents the Lund University Axial Turbine mean-line code (LUAX-T). LUAX-T is a reduced-order through-flow tool that is capable of designing highly loaded, cooled axial turbines. The stage computation consists of three iteration loops — cooling, entropy, and geometry iteration loop. The stage convergence method depends on whether the stage is part of the compressor turbine (CT) or power turbine (PT) stages, final CT stage, or final PT stage. LUAX-T was developed to design axial single- and twin-shaft turbines, and various working fluid and fuel compositions can be specified. LUAX-T uses the modified Ainley and Mathieson loss model, with the cooling computation based on the m*-model. Turbine geometries were established by applying various geometry correlations and methods. The validation was performed against a test turbine that was part of a European turbine development program. LUAX-T validated the axial PT of the test turbine, which consisted of two stages with rotational speed 13000 rpm. LUAX-T showed good agreement with the available performance data on the test turbine. The paper presented also the mean-line design of an axial cooled twin-shaft turbine. Design parameters were kept within limits of current practice. The total turbine power was 109 MW, of which the CT power was 55 MW. The CT was designed with two stages with a rotational speed of 9500 rpm, while the PT had two stages with a rotational speed of 6200 rpm. The total cooling mass flow was calculated to 31 kg/s, which corresponds to 23 \% of compressor inlet mass flow. LUAX-T proved capable of designing uncooled and cooled turbines.},

 abstract = {Development of a fast and accurate tool to estimate the performance of axial flow turbines in all range of working conditions including choked region is of great interest in the design steps of turbines. Mean-line (one-dimensional) analysis is one of the solutions that is computationally cost-effective along with producing accurate results. However, the development of a mean-line model that able to solve the flow in a choked turbine (one-row chocking and multi-row choking) is a challenging problem. This study presents a new algorithm for mean-line analysis of axial flow turbines with a set of well-posed boundary conditions, i.e., the inlet total pressure, the inlet total temperature, inlet flow angle, and outlet static pressure and calculates the flow condition through the turbine row-by-row. The proposed algorithm is implemented in an object-oriented C++ code named Axial Turbine Simulator (ATSim). The results of ATSim program is validated and verified under various working conditions, e.g., low and high-pressure ratios (choking condition), for four different turbine configurations including two uncooled single-stage turbines, an uncooled two-stage turbine, and a cooled three-stage turbine. ATSim provide good consistency with previous experimental and numerical studies. Moreover, the results show that ATSim is capable of estimating the performance of the turbine in a very short time over a wide range of working conditions, including choking (one-row choking or multi-row choking) region. •An efficient and real-time mean-line analysis of axial turbines is proposed.•The algorithm employed a well-posed set of boundary conditions, i.e.: pt,in, Tt,in, αin, ps,out.•The performance of turbines in a wide range of working conditions can be estimated.•The effect of blade film cooling is considered in the algorithm.•Results indicate good consistency with previous experimental and numerical studies.},

@article{tosto_dense-vapor_2021,
 abstract = {Paradigmatic compressible one-dimensional flows provide insights regarding the loss mechanisms of fluid machinery components typical of power and propulsion systems, like turbomachines and heat exchangers. Their performance also depends on the working fluid, thus, on both molecular complexity and thermodynamic state. Four typical flow configurations have been investigated, namely, Rayleigh and Fanno flows, mixing of two co-flowing streams, and flow injection into a mainstream. It was found that the Grüneisen parameter allows the quantitative characterization of the influence of molecular complexity on losses. Moreover, the influence of dense vapor effects has been evaluated and assessed in terms of other fluid parameters. The analysis allowed the quantification of how, in Rayleigh flows, the energy transferred as heat is converted into kinetic and internal energy of the fluid, and, in Fanno flows, entropy is generated due to friction. In Rayleigh flow, the fluid at the inlet of the channel must have more energy for the flow to choke, depending on the molecular complexity. Similarly, in Fanno flows and for a given value of the compressibility factor, molecular complexity determines the choking point in the channel, and the higher its value the further downstream is the location. Moreover, for both Fanno and Rayleigh flows, if the flow is subsonic and dense vapor effects are relevant, the Mach number varies non-monotonically along the channel. Finally, it was proven that the amount of entropy generated in mixing flows increases with both the fluid molecular complexity and with the thermodynamic non-ideality of the fluid states.},

 abstract = {In this work, we present an investigation about the sources of dissipation in adiabatic boundary layers of non-ideal compressible fluid flows. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of transitional, zero-pressure gradient boundary layer flows are performed for two fluids characterized by different complexity of the fluid molecules, namely, “air” and siloxane MM. Different sets of thermodynamic free-stream boundary conditions are selected to evaluate the influence of the fluid state on both the frictional loss and the dissipation mechanisms. The thermophysical properties of siloxane MM are calculated with a state-of-the-art equation of state. Results show that the dissipation due to both time-mean strain field, irreversible heat transfer, and turbulent dissipation differs significantly depending on both the molecular complexity of the fluid and its thermodynamic state. The dissipation coefficient calculated from the DNS results is then compared against the one obtained using a reduced-order model (ROM), which solves the two-dimensional boundary layer flow equations for an arbitrary fluid [M. Pini and C. De Servi, “Entropy generation in laminar boundary layers of non-ideal fluid flows,” in 2nd International Seminar on Non-Ideal Compressible Fluid Dynamics for Propulsion and Power (Springer, 2020), pp. 104–117]. Results from both the DNS and the ROM show that low values of the overall dissipation are observed in the case of fluids made of simple molecules, e.g., air, and if the fluid is at a thermodynamic state in the proximity of that of the vapor–liquid critical point.},

To reveal the energy conversion process and understand the energy loss principle are critical to improve the energy conversion efﬁciency. In this paper, the charge/discharge process analysis of an axial turbine based CAES with constant volume is executed in constant turbine inlet pressure mode and variable turbine inlet pressure mode. Firstly, the energy efﬁciency analysis of a whole round trip cycle of CAES system under design condition is carried out. The second law efﬁciencies of the operation mode 1 and the operation mode 2 are 44.56\% and 45.16\%, respectively. It also can be found that the throttling loss in operation mode 1 can be offset by the beneﬁts of higher isentropic efﬁciency of turbines. Then, the off-design analysis of these two operation modes is implemented by considering the different power levels and speed levels. The mass ﬂow rates of working ﬂuids across the expansion train both increase with the increased load rate or the decreased speed. The load rate or speed both have the positive effect on the exergy efﬁciency and the energy generated per unit volume of storage, but have the negative effect on the heat rate.},
