Tutorial 4: Multi-point design optimization
=========================================================

Functionality to demonstrate:

- Load YAML file with the same geometry as for the single-point case
- Optimize the turbine geometry for a set of operating points

    - Different speeds
    - Different pressure ratios

- Show convergence history and change in objective function value
- Plot the performance map of the obtained turbine and compare with the single-point optimization case
- Show that the multi-point optimization has less design-point efficiency but flatter performance curves.
