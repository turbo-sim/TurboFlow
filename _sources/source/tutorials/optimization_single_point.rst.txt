Tutorial 3: Single-point design optimization
=========================================================

Functionality to demonstrate:

- Load YAML file with geometry
- Optimize the turbine geometry for one set of operating conditions.
- Show convergence history and change in objective function value
- Show that the constraints are satisfied.
- Show that performance from design optimization is the same as the performance from root finding.
- Plot the performance map of the obtained turbine.
- Change one constraint (for instance, reduce the blade speed) and show how this affected the performance of the turbine
- Plot the performance map of the obtained turbine.
- Compare the equation-oriented approach to doing optimization based on performance-analysis evaluations:

    - Gradient based
    - Gradient free

- Highlight that the equation-oriented approach to optimization is the superior alternative.
