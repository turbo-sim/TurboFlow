Tutorial 1: Performance of a single-stage turbine
=====================================================

Functionality to demonstrate:

- Load YAML file with geometry
- Define the boundary conditions of the turbine. Define geometry where stator chokes first
- Compute performance at the design point
- Change exit pressure and draw performance lines:

    - Mass flow
    - Efficiency

- Change angular speed and draw performance lines:

    - Mass flow 
    - Efficiency

- Use the plot performance map functions to vary exit pressure and angular speed. Plot performance

    - Mass flow 
    - Efficiency

- Increase the area of the stator so that the rotor chokes first
- Plot the performance map of the new turbine to illustrate differences in performance
